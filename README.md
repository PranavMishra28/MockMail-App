# MockMail - Kotlin Email Client

MockMail is a Kotlin-based email client designed to make email debugging easy and efficient. By integrating Mockmail's virtual SMTP server, developers can simulate email sending without actually delivering emails to their intended recipients. Instead, all outgoing emails are captured in a single virtual inbox, allowing for comprehensive testing and debugging.

## Features
- **Virtual SMTP Server Support**: Easily configure Mockmailâ€™s virtual SMTP server to capture all outgoing emails in one inbox, regardless of the recipient.
- **Compose & Send**: Create and send emails within the app; all outgoing emails are routed to the virtual inbox.
- **Inbox & Sent Management**: View inbox and sent emails with organized lists, making debugging and tracking sent emails simple.
- **Drafts Support**: Save incomplete emails as drafts for later editing and sending.
- **Multiple Accounts**: Seamlessly switch between multiple email accounts.
- **Formatting Options**: Includes basic text formatting like bold, italic, and underline for message customization.
